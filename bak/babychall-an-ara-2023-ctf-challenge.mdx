## ðŸ‘¶ Challenge Overview

This crypto challenge, "Babychall," was a follow-up to a previous one. This time, instead of being given all the RSA parameters, we were only provided with three pairs of ciphertexts and their corresponding moduli.

The challenge gave us these sets of numbers:
* **Set 1:** `c1`, `n1`
* **Set 2:** `c2`, `n2`
* **Set 3:** `c3`, `n3`

The public exponent `e` was missing. The goal was to take these three encrypted messages and figure out the original plaintext flag.

## ðŸ§  Investigation and Discovery

Seeing three different ciphertexts and moduli, my first thought was that the same message was sent to three different recipients. Since the public exponent `e` wasn't provided, I made an assumption that a **common, small exponent** was used for all three encryptions. The most common value for this in CTFs is **`e = 3`**.

This assumption laid out a clear path forward. I was dealing with a system of congruences:
1.  $M^3 \equiv c_1 \pmod{n_1}$
2.  $M^3 \equiv c_2 \pmod{n_2}$
3.  $M^3 \equiv c_3 \pmod{n_3}$

The textbook method for solving a system like this is the **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**. My plan was to use the CRT to combine these three equations into a single one to find the value of $M^3$.

If my assumption about $e=3$ was correct, and because the message $M$ probably isn't enormous, then $M^3$ would likely be smaller than the product of the moduli ($n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3$). This means I could find the original message $M$ by simply taking the integer cube root of the result from the CRT. The theory felt solid; now I just needed a tool to handle the massive numbers.

## ðŸ”§ Cracking the Code with an Online Tool

Manually calculating the CRT for numbers of this size is not feasible. I searched for a tool to solve this specific problem and found a perfect online [RSA CRT Solver](https://asecuritysite.com/rsa/rsa_ctf02).

It was designed for exactly this scenario. All I had to do was:
1.  Copy and paste the values of `c1`, `n1`, `c2`, `n2`, `c3`, and `n3` into the corresponding fields on the website.
2.  The tool automatically assumes $e=3$.
3.  Click solve!

The tool instantly performed the CRT calculation, found the value of $M^3$, computed the cube root, and converted the resulting integer into readable text.

The output was the flag, confirming my approach was correct.

## âœ¨ Nice to Know: HÃ¥stad's Broadcast Attack

After solving the challenge, I learned that my intuitive approach actually has a formal name: **HÃ¥stad's Broadcast Attack**. This attack applies specifically to the scenario where a sender encrypts the same message $M$ with a small public exponent $e$ and sends it to multiple recipients, each with their own public modulus $n$.

By using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, an attacker can combine these ciphertexts to reconstruct $M^e$. If $M^e$ is smaller than the product of the moduli, the attacker can then calculate the $e$-th root to recover the original message $M$ directly. It's a classic vulnerability that highlights the dangers of using a low public exponent without proper padding.
