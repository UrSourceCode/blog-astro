##‚úâÔ∏è  Challenge Overview

This challenge, titled "Cryptography - Secrets Behind a Letter," got straight to the point. We were given a digital "letter" containing four very large numbers, labeled `p`, `q`, `c`, and a value for `e`.

Here's what we had to work with:

```
p: 12575333694121267690521971855691638144136810331188248236770880338905811883485064104865649834927819725617695554472100341361896162022311653301532810101344273 
q: 12497483426175072465852167936960526232284891876787981080671162783561411521675809112204573617358389742732546293502709585129205885726078492417109867512398747 
c: 36062934495731792908639535062833180651022813589535592851802572264328299027406413927346852454217627793315144892942026886980823622240157405717499787959943040540734122142838898482767541272677837091303824669912963572714656139422011853028133556111405072526509839846701570133437746102727644982344712571844332280218

e = 65537
```

The goal was clear: with these components, we had to decrypt the ciphertext `c` and uncover the hidden flag.

## üß† Investigation and Discovery

The moment I saw the variables `p`, `q`, `e`, and `c`, my brain immediately screamed **RSA!** This is the classic setup for an RSA cryptosystem, one of the most common forms of public-key cryptography.

Here's a quick breakdown of the components:

* `p` and `q`: These are two distinct, very large prime numbers. They are kept secret.
* `n`: The modulus, calculated by multiplying `p` and `q` ($n = p \times q$).
* `e`: The public exponent. The value `65537` is extremely common because it's a prime number and computationally efficient.
* `c`: The ciphertext, which is the encrypted message.

To decrypt the message, we need to find the original plaintext message, `m`. The decryption formula is $m = c^d \pmod{n}$, where `d` is the private exponent. The whole challenge boils down to finding `d`.

Fortunately, since both `p` and `q` were provided, calculating the private exponent `d` becomes a fairly straightforward mathematical task. The general steps are as follows:

1.  Calculate the modulus `n` using the formula: $n = p \times q$
2.  Compute Euler‚Äôs totient function $\phi(n)$, which is calculated as: $\phi(n) = (p - 1) \times (q - 1)$
3.  Find the private exponent `d` such that it satisfies the modular inverse of `e` modulo $\phi(n)$:
    $$
    d \equiv e^{-1} \pmod{\phi(n)}
    $$

While the theory is simple, performing these calculations with numbers this massive is impossible to do by hand. This meant it was time to find the right tool for the job.

## üîß Cracking the Code with RsaCtfTool

The Stack Overflow answer recommended a fantastic utility called `RsaCtfTool`, available on GitHub. As its name suggests, it's specifically designed to automate attacks and decryption for RSA challenges in CTFs.

After cloning the repository, I looked through the documentation. Since we had all the necessary components for a direct decryption (`p`, `q`, `e`, and `c`), we didn't need to perform any complex attacks. The `--uncipher` argument was exactly what I needed. It takes the ciphertext `c` and uses the provided key components to calculate the plaintext.

I ran the tool with the provided values, and it crunched the numbers in seconds.

The tool handled all the heavy lifting: calculating `n`, $\phi(n)$, finding the private key `d`, and then decrypting the message. The output gave me the plaintext integer, which, when converted to bytes, revealed the flag.

## üö© The Final Flag

Based on the output from `RsaCtfTool`, the decrypted message and the final flag was:

```
ARA2023{it_turn5_0ut_to_b3_an_rsa}
```

This was a fun, classic crypto challenge that served as a great reminder of how RSA works and the powerful open-source tools the security community has built.
