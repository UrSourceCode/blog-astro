## üìù The Challenge

> We went out last night to party during spring break, or was it a few nights from now or the other day we went out? Look, I don't know. It's spring break. All I know is this dude Arbys was buying drinks and then next thing I know: Bam, wake up and everybody's all weird. Can you come get me? Anna's god knows where, but I'll help you find her if you find me. No idea where I am though. Here's a pic of a super shady atm by the bar I woke up in front of. Everything's closed but I think we sang here last night.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Investigation and Discovery

The challenge gives us a story and an image file, [totallysafeatm.jpg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18uKFQthgu33uzmWCpl8GO1YdC8NTcuzK/view?usp=sharing). The goal is to find a date and a location name. Whenever an original image file is provided in a challenge, the first thing to check for is hidden data embedded within the file itself.

My immediate plan was to inspect the image's **EXIF metadata**. This data, often stored automatically by cameras and smartphones, can contain a wealth of information, including timestamps and, crucially, GPS coordinates. My tool of choice for this is `exiftool`.

## üîß Executing the Solution

I ran `exiftool` on the image file to see what data it held.

The output immediately gave me the two most important clues:
* **Create Date:** `2033:03:16 12:05:01`
* **GPS Position:** `28 deg 32' 27.60" N, 81 deg 22' 4.80" W`

With the GPS coordinates, I used an online [GPS Coordinates Finder](https://gps-coordinates.org/) to pinpoint the location on a map.

The coordinates placed me on a street in Orlando, Florida. To identify the bar mentioned in the prompt, I switched to Google Maps Street View for that exact location. Looking around, I found a bar right next to the ATM called **"Planet Rose"**.

I now had both parts of the flag:
* **Date (`yyyymmdd`):** From the EXIF data, `20330316`.
* **Bar Name:** From Street View, `planetrose`.

## ‚ú® A Note on EXIF Data

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) is a standard that embeds metadata into image files. This can include camera settings, lens information, timestamps, and‚Äîif location services are enabled on the device‚Äîprecise GPS coordinates. This challenge is a classic reminder of how much information can be unintentionally shared through a single photo, making EXIF data a fundamental tool in OSINT investigations.

## üö© The Final Flag

Combining the date and the bar name according to the specified format (`nicc{yyyymmddbarname}`), I got the final flag:

```
nicc{20330316planetrose}
```
