## ðŸ¥§ Challenge Overview
Help is a Cryptography challenge that giving us 32 separate 7-bit binary numbers without any clear instruction. However, a small clue hidden in the description â€” _"display in the office"_ â€” points us toward an unconventional but clever decoding method.

The objective: interpret the 7-bit binary values as representations of characters on a **seven-segment display**, and reveal the hidden flag.

## ðŸ§  Investigation and Discovery

At first glance, the given binary values didnâ€™t seem to follow any standard ASCII format. After trying common decoding methods without success, one phrase stood out in the challenge prompt:

> display in the office

This prompted a new line of thinking â€” what if these binary values werenâ€™t characters in a traditional encoding scheme, but rather **segment activations on a seven-segment digital display**, like those used in clocks or calculators?

After Googling _"display in 7-bit binary"_, the results were promising:

The idea: each 7-bit binary represents one combination of segments (a-g) being turned on or off on a seven-segment display. This method is often used in embedded systems and digital clocks.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Manual Work

I tried using [this dCode seven-segment decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/7-segment-display) to convert each binary to a character, but the results were inconsistent. Some characters showed up as symbols or gibberish, likely due to ambiguity in how seven-segment displays handle lowercase letters or undefined combinations.

So instead of relying on automated tools, I took the analog approach: pen and paper.

I manually sketched out each 7-bit pattern using seven-segment layouts, treating each bit as a segment (a-g). From this, I was able to deduce the actual characters being formed.

It was **mindblowing** how well it worked:

## ðŸš© The Final Flag

After decoding all 32 seven-segment binaries manually, I was able to spell out the flag:
