## üß≠ Initial Investigation & The Red Herring

The most unique visual clue in the provided image was the **"Pentol Mbokdhe"** food cart. My immediate strategy was to search for this on Google Maps.

<img src="/assets/pentol.png" alt="A Google Maps search result for 'Pentol Mbokdhe'." style={{ width: "100%" }} />

The search returned a location with the Plus Code `69FC+8V` and listed its *kelurahan* (subdistrict) as `NGESTIHARJO`. Believing I had found it, I constructed the flag `JCTF2023{69FC+8V_NGESTIHARJO}`, but it was incorrect. The food cart's location was a trap.

## üìç Finding the Correct Location

After the failed attempt, I re-read the description and focused on the key directional clue I had overlooked: **"headed from Tugu Jogja to the north."**

I changed my strategy completely. Ignoring the food cart, I centered my map on the Tugu Jogja landmark and began to visually scan northward for Indomaret stores, trying to match the street view with the challenge image.

This approach quickly led me to the correct store.

Upon inspection, I found the twist: the Indomaret had the *same* Plus Code (`69FC+8V`) but was located in a different *kelurahan*: **`TERBAN`**.

## ‚ú® A Note on the Google Maps Quirk

This challenge cleverly exploits a common quirk in Google Maps. The Indomaret store and the "Pentol Mbokdhe" food cart are at the same physical location, but their registered map pins are slightly different. This resulted in them being assigned to two different administrative subdistricts, with the food cart's pin serving as the misdirection.

## üö© The Final Flag

Using the correct details from the Indomaret's official map pin, the final flag was:

```
JCTF2023{69FC+8V_TERBAN}
```
