## ü•ß Challenge Overview

**PIE TIME** is a binary exploitation challenge where we take advantage of a program that lets us input any address to jump to. The goal is to redirect execution to the hidden `win()` function, which prints the flag.

We‚Äôre given two files:
- `vuln` ‚Äî the compiled binary
- `vuln.c` ‚Äî the C source code

The twist? The binary uses PIE (Position Independent Executable), meaning the memory layout is randomized every time the program runs.

---

## üß© Reviewing the Code

Here‚Äôs the key part of the code:

```c
scanf("%lx", &val);
void (*foo)(void) = (void (*)())val;
foo();
```

This snippet gives us full control over where the program jumps. All we need is the correct address.

---

## üîç Exploitation Steps

### 1. Check Binary Protections

We start by checking the binary's protections using `checksec`.

```bash
checksec vuln
```

This confirms that PIE is enabled.

Because of PIE, the program‚Äôs memory layout will change every time it runs. That means we can‚Äôt rely on hardcoded addresses.

---

### 2. Get the Offset of `win()`

Next, we need the relative offset of the `win()` function inside the binary.

We run:

```bash
nm vuln | grep ' win'
```

Output:

```bash
00000000000012a7 T win
```

This tells us that `win()` is located at offset `0x12a7` from the base of the binary.

---

### 3. Calculate the Runtime Address

To get the actual runtime address of `win()`, we follow these steps:

#### a. Run the binary in `pwndbg`

```bash
pwndbg ./vuln
r
```

#### b. Use `vmmap` to find the base address

Once the binary is running, type:

```bash
vmmap
```

This gives us the memory layout. Look for the base address where the binary is loaded.

<img src="/pietime/vmmap.png" alt="VMMap Output" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

Let‚Äôs say the base address is:

```
0x555555554000
```

#### c. Add the offset of `win()` to the base address

```bash
0x555555554000 + 0x12a7 = 0x55555555412a7
```

That‚Äôs the runtime address we‚Äôll use.

---

#### üß† Why We Used `0x555555554000` as the Base

Even though the `.text` section (actual code) starts at `0x555555555000`, the offsets reported by `nm` are relative to the very start of the ELF binary ‚Äî which is `0x555555554000`.

```bash
00000000000012a7 T win
```

This means `win()` is located 0x12a7 bytes from the start of the ELF.

So the correct address is:

```bash
real_address = 0x555555554000  # base from vmmap
             + 0x12a7         # offset from nm
             = 0x5555555552a7
```

Using `0x555555555000` instead would result in an incorrect jump ‚Äî 0x100 bytes too early ‚Äî and most likely a crash.

---

#### üì¶ How PIE and ELF Mapping Work

When a PIE binary is loaded:

- The entire ELF binary (headers + code + data) is mapped starting at the base, e.g., `0x555555554000`
- The `.text` section typically starts at offset `0x1000`, making its virtual address `0x555555555000`
- However, all function offsets from `nm` are relative to the start of the binary, not the `.text` section

To get the real address of a function:
1. Get the base address using `vmmap`
2. Add the function's offset from `nm`

---

### 4. Jump to `win()`

Now that we have the runtime address of `win()`, we run the binary normally and input the address when prompted:

```bash
Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345: 0x55555555412a7
```

<img src="/pietime/flag.png" alt="Flag Printed" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

That jumps directly into `win()` and prints the flag.

---

### 5. Run It on the Remote Server

When we connect to the remote instance via `nc`, the program prints the address of `main()`.

We do the following:

1. Subtract the known offset of `main()` from that address to get the base
2. Add `0x12a7` to get the address of `win()`
3. Enter that value when prompted

---

## üí° Understanding PIE and Offsets

In PIE-enabled binaries:
- Absolute addresses are randomized on each run
- Offsets inside the binary stay consistent

So, if we can figure out the base address at runtime, we can always find `win()`.

> `win()` is always 0x12a7 bytes after the base address.

---

## üß† Final Thoughts

This challenge is a great intro to PIE exploitation: no stack smashing, no weird shellcode ‚Äî just pure calculated jumping based on offsets.
