		Hey, I’m Elshe — a professional tinkerer, part-time overthinker, and full-time human trying to make sense of the digital (and real) world. This little nook of the internet is where I toss in ideas, build cool (and weird) stuff, and ramble when caffeine kicks in harder than expected.
	</p>

	<p>
		My work? Somewhere between code wizardry and breaking things in entirely new ways. If it compiles, it ships. If it doesn’t… well, that’s tomorrow’s problem. I love side projects, especially the ones I start and then forget why. Occasionally, I even finish one.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here you’ll find experimental projects, quirky thoughts, code that’s either genius or gremlin, and maybe a few digital breadcrumbs of actual insight. It’s not a portfolio — it’s a playground, and you’re welcome to hang around.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe in learning by doing (and messing up). Sometimes the best way to figure things out is to dive in headfirst and yell “I got this!” while frantically Googling on the side. Progress, not perfection — that’s the motto here.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to poke around, read, scroll, and maybe — just maybe — find something useful, inspiring, or at least mildly entertaining. And remember: this site is a work in progress. Just like its creator.
