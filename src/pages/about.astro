    Hi, I'm Elshe. I write code, break things (accidentally), and explore ideas that don’t always make sense at first — and that’s the fun of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is a digital journal of the stuff I'm working on, learning, or just curious about. It’s not polished, but it’s honest — and always a work in progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re into real-world coding, side projects, and occasional tech ramblings, feel free to explore.
